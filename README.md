A simple ARIMA model to perform Time-series analysis on a dataset obtained using Arduino Nano, current sensors and voltage sensors.
An accurate prediction for Global Active Power, Global Reactive Power, and the Sub-Metering readings is obtained.
Detects anomalies in power consumption by setting a threshold.
Upon detection of the anomaly, a telegram alert is sent to the user informing them of abnormal power consumption.
